**Me:**

I currently wear multiple hats across bio/ML/CS at Cradle.bio. These days I am generally interested in scientific ML, and specifically the application of ML to unsolved problems in biology!

I also hold an honorary lectureship at Imperial College London. In past lives I previously wore the same multitude of hats at Google X, and did my PhD at the University of Oxford.
